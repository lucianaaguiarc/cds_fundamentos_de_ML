# Subject Machine Learning Fundamentals of Comunidade DS 
Goal: Implement KNN algorithm to a cred card dataset to classify if the client should have a raise on their credit card limit.

Steps of KNN training (how it works)*:
1) Read the data
2) Set a number od neighbors
For each exemple without the label:
3) Calculate the distance of the new unlabeled data and the labeled data
4) Find the k nearst neighbors 
5) Identify the the label of the k nearst neighbors
6) Calculate the mode of the k nearst neighbors
7) Classify the data based on the mode of the closest neigbors

*This steps were based on the discipline Machine Learning Fundamentals of the Comunidade DS course
